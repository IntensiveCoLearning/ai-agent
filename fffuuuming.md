- Agent: anything that can be viewed as 
    - **perceiving its environment** through sensors
    - **acting upon that environment** through actuators
- LLM agent: use **language**, e.g. **generating tokens** to do the above, although perception of other input modalities is possible, language is still important in **reasoning** and **communication**

LLM agent workflow:

There still remain challenges for LLM agent such as **self-reflection (meta reasoning), state inferences, replanning, synthetic data, internalized search...**, but thanks to the use of language, both of its expressiveness and adaptivity are high, and language-based inferences makes its reasoning flexible (but fuzzy)
